## Data Normalization

- Each table should serve district and specific purpose

- In order to do so:

  > 1. Eliminate redundant data
  > 2. Minimize errors and anomalies
  > 3. Simplify queries

  **And build relationship** between tables!

## Data table vs. Lookup table

- Data table contains observations, whereas Lookup table contains descriptive information(expanding dimension)
- Lookup table normally consists of Primary Keys and its descriptive attributes;
  Data table normally consists of Foreign Keys and its observations.
- N:1 relationship is valid in most case building relationship between such tables.
