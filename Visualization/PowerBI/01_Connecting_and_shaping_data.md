## Types of data connectors

Power BI can connect various types of source data:

- **Flat files** like csv, text, xls...
- **Folders**
- **Databases** like SQL, Access, Oracle, BigQuery...
- **Online Services** like Sharepoint, GitHub, Gogle Analytics...
- and Others

Once connected, it will lead to Query Editor regardless of the types of data connectors



## THE QUERY EDITOR (a.k.a. Power Query)

Much of the preprocessing is done from the Query Editor.
You can use "M Code" from the **Formula Bar** of Query Editor to carry out ETL in a more detailed level.
**Query Pane** on the left side allows customization via GUI from a data table perspective.
**Applied Steps** on the right side lets you process data more on column perspective.
